ase seems not to support ultrasoft pseudopotentials from vasp at the moment:
workaround: 
potpaw_GGA: 'PW91' -> US_PP from potUSPP_GGA.tar.gz
potpaw_PBE: 'PBE' -> PAW_PP from potpaw_PBE.54.tar.gz

original files delivered with VASP, exception:
* in potpaw_GGA/Bi/POTCAR:
VRHFIN =Pb changed to VRHFIN =Bi in POTCAR
(seems to be a typo which leads to Bi replaced by Pb in CONTCAR file)
